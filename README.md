repository for Codespace project

Simply open todoapp.html locally to run the application

At first the list of tasks is populated by some random tasks for demonstration purposes

Add new tasks using the inputs near the top of the page, underneath the head "Add New Task"

Edit tasks by Clicking the button that is labeled "Change Display Mode: Edit"
Each task will have a set of inputs that allow you to change the values

Return to the main page by pressing the same button, now labeled "Change Display Mode: View"

The view mode is more suited to sorting the list in various ways.
Each field can be sorted in ascending, descending or most recent.
Change the sorting order by clicking on the header of that field.
If multiple fields are set to be sorted then they are sorted by most to least relevant field:
    i.e: Category->DueDate->Priority->Label
